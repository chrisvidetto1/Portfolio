# Machine Learning Readmission Project
Capstone Master's Degree project that examined data from the UCI Repository of over 62,000 patients from over 100 hospitals. Performed exploratory data analysis and visualizations to initially become familiar with the data to begin feature engineering. Compared multiple machine learning algorithms for performance. Finally, evaluated the featre significance on the 30-day readmission rate of patients, to help hospitals better predict which patients needed more care after discharge.

# EDA_Medicare
This project used a publicly-available data set located on the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare website and was published in 2018. The data was extracted from the Medicare Part D Drug Spending Dashboard and imported into a Jupyter notebook on Google Colab for statistical analysis to gain insight into the pharmaceutical price structure and relationship of drug manufacturers vs. drug price.

# API_GitHub
A self-contained program that uses a web application programming interface (API) to automatically request specific information from a website. In this case I used the GitHub API to retrieve information about the most popular/most-starred repositories as of 9/29/20. The data was then used to generate a visualization that will always be up to date even though the data might be rapidly changing.

# COVID19_EDA
This exploratory data analysis was performed on a current data set located on the HealthData.gov website. The data was extracted on 9/27/20 in a .csv and imported into a server on AWS that was created specifically to store this data for uncorrupted access. SQL was then written to query the data through a Jupyter notebook on Google Colab for statistical analysis and visualization.
